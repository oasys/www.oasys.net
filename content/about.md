I'm currently employed at [Akamai Technologies](https://www.akamai.com)
as a Principal SRE in the Cloud Technology Group, working with the
[Linode](https://www.linode.com) Cloud Network Infrastructure team on
building automation and tooling for ongoing management and expansion of
networking infrastructure.

Previously, I led the networking team at [Bowdoin
College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/) as the Director of Networking and
Infrastructure for over 19 years. Before my time in Higher Education, I
worked primarily in the ISP industry, founding a start-up in 1995 and
later at regional and large national providers.  I have also had the
opportunity to complete various consulting projects in the areas of
network design, content distribution, systems integration, and cloud
enablement.

I love sharing tidbits and thoughts about what I'm currently working
on, both for my own reference and as a way to help others who might be
trying to solve a similar issue or problem.

If you have comments, ideas, or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
