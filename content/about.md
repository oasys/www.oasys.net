I've led the networking team at [Bowdoin
College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/) as the Director of Networking and
Infrastructure since 2003. Before my time in Higher Education, I worked
primarily in the ISP industry, founding a start-up in 1995 and later at
regional and large national providers.  I have also had to opportunity
to complete various consulting projects in the areas of network design,
content distribution, systems integration, and cloud enablement.

I love sharing tidbits and thoughts about what I'm currently working
on, both for my own reference and as a way to help others who might be
trying to solve a similar issue or problem.

If you have comments, ideas, or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
