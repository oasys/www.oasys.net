A [cow-orker][orking cows] came to me with a puppet issue today.  He was
trying to remove a package from a fleet of RedHat servers, using `ensure
=> absent` in the package resource, but it was failing:

```text
Error: Execution of '/bin/rpm -e firefox' returned 1: error: "firefox" specifies multiple packages:
  firefox-78.9.0-1.el7_9.x86_64
  firefox-78.9.0-1.el7_9.i686
Error: /Stage[main]/Profile::Base::Firefox/Package[firefox]/ensure: change from '78.9.0-1.el7_9' to 'absent' failed: Execution of '/bin/rpm -e firefox' returned 1: error: "firefox" specifies multiple packages:
  firefox-78.9.0-1.el7_9.x86_64
  firefox-78.9.0-1.el7_9.i686
```

A quick search showed that rpm has an `--allmatches` option.  From `rpm(8)`:

```text
--allmatches
       Remove all versions of the package which match PACKAGE_NAME.
       Normally an error is issued if PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.
```

Since the [rpm provider][rpm] has the `uninstall_options` feature,
I suggested he add `uninstall_options => [ '--allmatches' ]` to the
[package][package] resource.  Unfortunately this failed, too.  Running a
debug showed that it was still just executing `rpm -e` and ignoring the
additional options.

Looking further, I see that the [yum provider][yum] is actually
the default on RedHat, and that it does _not_ support the
`uninstall_options` feature.

> yum
>
> Support via `yum`.

> - Default for: `osfamily` == `redhat`
> - Supported features: `install_options`, `installable`, `purgeable`,
> `uninstallable`, `upgradeable`, `versionable`, `virtual_packages`

Our second try was a success:

```puppet
package { 'firefox':
  ensure            => absent,
  provider          => 'rpm',
  uninstall_options => [ '--allmatches', '--nodeps' ],
}
```
